<p>CinnMD is the <b>premiere</b> all online medical telecommunications company in Cinnaminson! Founded in 2020 in the height of the COVID-19 Pandemic, CinnMD's goal was to do one thing: provide a safe, easy telecommunications option to prevent the spread. After a long time coming, CinnMD created it's website, so that people like you could get help. While small, CinnMD's netowrk connects to other medical specialists to get you the best treatment or service that you can. CinnMD plans on opening up offices n the future, but is focusing on an all online presence at the moment to keep up with the changing times. No need to fear, though! If you need in person services CinnMD will point you in the right direction.</p>

<p>A lot of people ask, <b>why go to CinnMD over a real doctor?</b> The answer is truly the ease of online medical practices. With lots of workers still from home, schooling still hybridized or at home, and not much traveling places, CinnMD seeks to reduce your in person contacts for both parties' safety.</p>

<p>With a large network of in person doctors, pharmacies, and other facilities, we know our stuff when talking about your health. Both mentally and physically, it is important to stay healthy and safe, which is why we are dedicated to making this process as easy and cost efficient for you. CinnMD works to cover many different health insurance plans, and will work to try to make something fit accordingly. If not, you can pay a fee for our services, but we are trying our best being a new company to have competitive rates as well as our professional services.</p>

<p>Here at CinnMD, we have big goals. To keep you safe is first, but also to branch out to be an all in one medical stop on the internet. Right now, our services are limited to South Jersey residents, but in the future, we hope to provide telemedicine to others who are possibly across the country or even the globe. Helping others will always be a priority, no matter how big or small our patient size is.</p>
