<p> A very common question that we get is what we actually treat. Sadly, since we do not allow people into our facilities at the moment, we cannot treat anything in person. However, that does not mean that we cannot help with other issues. For Both Children and Adults, there are multiple differnt categories that we cover.</p>
<ul>
